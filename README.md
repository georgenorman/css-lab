# CSS Lab

CSS experiments for the [CSS Overview](http://www.thruzero.com/jcat3/apps/resources/resources.jsf?rid=css.overview) at ThruZero.

## Caveats

The purpose of CSS Lab is to explore CSS, not to demonstrate efficient code or best practice.
Some JavaScript is included, but that too is mostly an exploration and is only used to support page rendering.

Third-party libraries (e.g., jQuery) are not used, because that would interfere with the goal of getting exposed to the fundamentals
(i.e., using jQuery would be like exploring the Amazon by jet -
instead, I want to explore it on foot, even if it means sinking to my eyebrows in quicksand).
